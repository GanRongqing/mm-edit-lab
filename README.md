# Hierarchical Semantic-to-Pixel Chain-of-Thought Generation for Multimodal Editing

## 📅 First public timestamp: 2025-08-05

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project records and claims the original idea of **Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for unified multimodal understanding and generation**, with a novel explicit *semantic-to-pixel sequential generation pipeline*. The framework is designed for complex image editing and subject-driven generation tasks, aiming to bridge high-level semantic planning with pixel-level synthesis in a controllable and interpretable way.

## 💡 Key Idea

- **Two-Stage Reasoning and Generation**:
  1. **Semantic Reasoning Stage**: The model first performs high-level semantic analysis and planning of the input (e.g., describing editing intent, object-level layout, relationships, and reasoning steps), leveraging a semantic encoder (such as ViT/CLIP) and producing a structured intermediate semantic representation or CoT sequence.
  2. **Pixel Generation Stage**: Conditioned on the semantic plan, a pixel-level generator (e.g., VQ-VAE/Flux) synthesizes high-quality images or edited regions, ensuring consistency with the semantic intent and enabling fine-grained editing.

- **Explicit CoT Structure**: The generation process is organized as a **Chain-of-Thought**, where the model explicitly outputs/records each semantic and pixel-level reasoning step, improving interpretability, controllability, and complex task generalization.

- **Task Focus**: Particularly suited for subject-driven generation, compositional scene synthesis, complex controllable editing, and multi-step multimodal reasoning.

## 🔥 Motivation

Traditional end-to-end image generation models often entangle semantic planning with low-level pixel synthesis, limiting controllability and explainability—especially in complex editing or subject-driven tasks. By explicitly separating and serializing semantic and pixel-level reasoning in a CoT framework, we aim to:
- Enhance compositional generalization and controllable generation;
- Enable more precise, interpretable, and editable multimodal outputs;
- Facilitate fine-grained RLHF, multi-objective optimization, and robust human-in-the-loop interaction.

## 🧩 Method Outline

1. **Input**: Text prompt, image, or structured editing request.
2. **Stage 1 - Semantic CoT Planning**:
   - The model analyzes and decomposes the task into semantic steps (e.g., object detection, relationship reasoning, region planning).
   - Outputs an explicit semantic plan or chain of thought (natural language or structured tokens).
3. **Stage 2 - Pixel-level Synthesis**:
   - The pixel generator takes the semantic plan as condition.
   - Synthesizes edited or generated images in accordance with the semantic intent.
   - Optionally, stepwise feedback or correction is supported.
4. **(Optional) RLHF & Multi-objective Reward**: Supports chain-level or stepwise reward signals for RL fine-tuning.

## 📈 Applications
